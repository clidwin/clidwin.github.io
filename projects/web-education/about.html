        <p>Most of what I know about web technologies has come from a necessity for me to do something involving a website, whether that necessity has been to create/edit a blog, implement a web-based front-end, or figure out why something isn’t working while I’m using the internet. Since my interests have consistently been in the realm of front-end engineering and user experience, I wanted to start spending more time understanding these technologies as intentional components as opposed to hacks that help me achieve a desired end result.</p>

<p>Since I wanted to learn more about web development concepts and part of my reason for doing so was because I could not find a good resource with the information, I decided to put together modules of the information I found related to topics in web technologies for my own reference and to share with others. Most of my focus was on CSS was because it aligned with some of my other research on how motion affects interaction, but in the future I am excited to look at other web technologies such as Javascript and SASS.</p>
        
        <h2>About Codepen</h2>
        <p>One of the ways I enjoy learning is applying a concept in practice through trying things out, so it was important to me to have an interactive component to these modules. Over my past seven years of studying computer science, I have used a few web coding tools such as <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/" href="_blank">JSFiddle</a>, but I chose to use <a href="http://codepen.io/" target="_blank">CodePen</a> for this project because the interface is flexible and provides an "embedded" option to show both the code and the final product in a webpage.</p>
        <p>Each "pen" (an instance of CodePen) includes in the most basic instance HTML, CSS, Javascript, and a rendered browser window, providing a lot of information and possibilities for both people creating and viewing the pens. In particular, I utilize and encourage the "Edit with Codepen" feature in the upper-right corner of the CodePen widget, which allows someone to interact with the pen and alter it for their own use.</p>
