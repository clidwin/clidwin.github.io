    	<h1>Module 3: CSS Animations</h1>
    	<p>A static website provides content that is easy to stylize and does not rely on timing (other than page loading time) to deliver information. This can be useful to translate website content from image to text based versions of the site and improve consistency across browsers.</p>
      <p>Applying motion to a website, though, creates opportunities for different forms of communication and an eye-catching experience for users. Menus that slide down on a hover or notifications that bounce to draw a user's attention are just two examples of possible animations that create both a visual for the eye to follow as content is exposed and notify the user about a change in the interface or system. Javascript was previously needed to provide animations like these, but with the introduction of CSS3, it is possible to create some animations by using new CSS keywords such as <span class="keyword">keyframe</span> and <span class="keyword">animation</span>.</p>

    	<h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>CSS animations can be created to either run infinitely when the page is loaded, conditionally based on a hover or other action, or a set number of times as defined by the animation keyword. This variety allows for a mulAn atitude of possible implementations and use cases, giving the designer more flexibility to use CSS3 (as opposed to javascript) for these tasks.</p>

      <p>This module will discuss the various components involved in creating a CSS3 animation as well as build on the concept of transforms from the last module.</p>
