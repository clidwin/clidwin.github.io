    	<h1>CSS Animations: Keyframes</h1>
    	<p>Keyframes dictate when changes occur and what changes are being made in an animation. If you have used animation applications such as Autodesk Maya, Adobe After Effects, or Maxon's Cinema 4D before, keyframes have the same functionality in these programs as they do in CSS3.</p>
      <p>This section will go over the syntax for keyframes in CSS3 as well an introduction to what content could be animated with keyframes. Just like with animation applications, though, keyframes do not automatically play animations. The next section will discuss how to activate animations, or in other words explain what is used instead of a "play button" to show the keyframes in motion.</p>
      <h2>Interactive Example</h2>
      <p>This example shows a blue circle with keyframes prepared to change its position and color based on the percentage of the animation completed. Note that there is no movement yet because the animation has not been activated.</p>
      <div class="codepen-wrapper">
        <p data-height="268" data-theme-id="9039" data-slug-hash="uHGqm" data-default-tab="result" data-user="clidwin" class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/clidwin/pen/uHGqm/'>Animation Keyframing</a> by Christina (<a href='http://codepen.io/clidwin'>@clidwin</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.</p>
        <script async src="//codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>
      </div>
      <p>Instead of percentages, use <span class="keyword">from{}</span> and <span class="keyword">to{}</span> to define the ball bounces animation. After reading through the next section, see if you can alter this example to make the ball move and change colors in the window.</p>

      <h2><span class="keyword">@keyframes [INSERT_NAME] {}</span></h2>
      <p>Keyframes are set up syntactically by using the <span class="keyword">@keyframes</span><sup>[1]</sup> selector followed by a name you select to represent the keyframes (This is similar to the <span class="keyword">@media</span> selector used for responsiveness, as opposed to properties like <span class="keyword">background-color</span>). The variable name you get to select can be any alphanumeric string as long as it starts with a letter and is not already used by another selector, but by convention the naming is uppercase and has a name that relates to the action being animated.</p>
      <p>After the variable name are open and closing curly braces ({}), which open and close the declaration part of the keyframe CSS rule. All other content relating to keyframes will be contained inside these braces.</p>
      
      <h2>Timing Rules</h2>
      <p>The <span class="keyword">@keyframes [INSERT_NAME] {}</span> syntax encapsulates a set of CSS rules, each of which are a keyframe (or set of keyframes) that contain the properites you would like to have applied at that point in the animation. Specifically, these CSS rules relate to the time of the animation, and can come in two forms: percentages in the inclusive range of 0% and 100%, and the selectors <span class="keyword">from{}</span> and <span class="keyword">to{}</span>.</p>
      <p>Percentages are flexible and are called by listing the value of the percent, followed by the percentage, and concluded with the opening and closing curly braces. Any percentage value can be chosen, and the same properties can be applied to multiple percentages by grouping the percentages with commas such as <span class="keyword">0%, 100%</span>.</p>
      <p>A simpler but less flexible version of timing rules is <span class="keyword">from{}</span> and <span class="keyword">to{}</span>. <span class="keyword">from{}</span> contains properties that are applied at the start of the animation, and <span class="keyword">to{}</span> contains properties that are applied at the end of the animation.</p>
      <p>In both cases of timing rules, CSS calculates intermediate steps of the animations to show a smooth transition between property values.</p>

      <h2>Keyframed Content</h2>
      <p>Just like with regular CSS selectors, properties such as <span class="keyword">background-color</span>, <span class="keyword">margin</span>, and <span class="keyword">width</span> can all be specified inside a timing rule.</p>

          <sup>[1]</sup> The keyframes selector is, as of this module's writing, an experimental feature, and therefore requires <a href="prefixes.html" target="_blank">Vendor Prefixes</a>. These prefixes go in between the @ symbol and "keyframes", so to use keyframes for Firefox, the syntax would be <span class="keyword">@-moz-keyframes</span>.</p>
