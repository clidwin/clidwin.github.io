    		<a href="http://www.justinaguilar.com/animations/" target="_blank">CSS3 Animation Cheat Sheet</a> is a fun and interactive way to see a small sample of possible CSS3 animations. The site also has a downloadable CSS file that can be used to apply these animations to your own site.

        <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-animations/" target="_blank">W3C: CSS Animations</a> is the official documentation on CSS Animations. The provider, W3C, is the World Wide Web Consortium, which is the group that develops standards for the web. It is a more technical source than some of the other sites, but is a great resource to see what the current standards are and what future standards are being drafted.

    		<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation" target="_blank">Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)</a> is essentially a Wikipedia for web technologies. It is useful for looking up what values a property can have, but what I find especially valuable are its up-to-date listings of what browsers support a certain property.

        <a href="http://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/keyframe-animation-syntax/" target="_blank">Keyframe Animation Syntax</a> is a code snippet within the CSS-Tricks website which goes over the basics of CSS3 Animations. This post provides a different way for understanding CSS3 animations by discussing different syntaxes, and the site as a whole is a great resource for both general topics as well as examples of commonly created elements.
