    	<h1>Module 2: CSS Transforms</h1>
    	<p>No matter what tool(s) you use to create a mockup of your designs, it is useful to understand how to tweak styling through code so that you can transform your designs into live websites. Knowing CSS is essential to this process and understanding some of the technical sophistication for concepts such as responsiveness and platform inconsistencies will help inform your design decisions as well.</p>
      <p>This section builds on the principles of basic CSS and delves into the concept of transforms, a CSS3 property allows web designers and developers to perform actions such as translations, rotations, skewing, and applying perspectives. Transforms not only provide alterations to static content, but also can be used to provide visual interest in CSS3 animations (which will be further discussed in the next module).</p>

    	<h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>A <span class="keyword">transform</span> in CSS is a property that changes the way an element interacts with the grid structure of the DOM (Document Object Model, or element hierarchy). The property affects the element similar to the Marquee tools in Photoshop, manipulating the element as a whole instead of each of its contents individually.</p>

      <p>The values for the transform property are the functions matrix, rotate, scale, skew, and translate. There are also sub-properties of transform that allow us to specify the origin, style, and perspective of the transform.</p>
