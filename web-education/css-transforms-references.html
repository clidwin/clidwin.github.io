    		<a href="http://htmlandcssbook.com/">Jon Duckett's HTML and CSS</a> is one of my favorite web reference books. It is well designed, well written, and well executed. I particularly enjoy how each chapter is structured around both a broad topic and focused example that applies attributes of the chapter. Well worth the read for people who either do not have prior experience in HTML and/or CSS or want a good reference book on these subjects.

    		<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS">Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)</a> is essentially a Wikipedia for web technologies. It is useful for looking up what values a property can have, but what I find especially valuable are its up-to-date listings of what browsers support a certain property.

    		<a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2502006">SeeSS: Seeing What I Broke - Visualizing Change Impact of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</a> is an article that proposes a methodology to show the scope of elements effected by a CSS property change. The proposal is based on the observation that a difficult part of writing CSS is seeing how one property change affects the site as a whole. It is a technical journal article, but has interesting insights on where web developer tools are lacking and how the proposed SeeSS system is a viable option.
